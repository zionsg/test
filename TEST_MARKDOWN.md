# Test Markdown

Trying to find Markdown that renders properly in a Markdown editor, GitHub and especially Bitbucket.
Main issue is with code blocks in lists!

### Test Section

```
Code block
for section
```

- 1st item in list

  ```
  Code block
  for 1st item in list
  ```

- 2nd item in list

  + 1st subitem for 2nd item in list

    ```
    Code block
    1st subitem for 2nd item in list
    ```

- 3rd item in list. Has no code blocks.
