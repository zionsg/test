Test repository

`master` branch

## Installation
- As this module is not available on Packagist, the GitHub repository needs to be added to `composer.json` in the
  project.

  ```
  {
    "repositories": [
        {
            "type": "git",
            "url": "https://github.com/zionsg/test"
        }
    ]
  }
  ```
- Run `composer require zionsg/test` to get the latest release in the `master` branch.
